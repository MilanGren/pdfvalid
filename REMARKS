PDF file src/test/resources/example_065.pdf: I downloaded it from the internet (https://tcpdf.org/examples/example_065/) 
as 1b-valid, however, different on-line validators give different results.. On-line vera-based validator says its not 1b-valid, this project 
also says its not 1b-valid (see tests), HOWEVER, they both return 'validation profile' 1b.

.. very similar situation is about src/test/resources/latex_for_beginner-2u.pdf (converted to be valid by https://www.pdfen.com/pdf-a-validator)




it seems that in case of VERA based validator we have 'two' levels of pdf validation results:

1. Validation Profile (represented by flavourId in this project) which gives consistent results with other online validators
2. PDF/A compliance: even if Validation Profile is for example 1b, the result may be 'Failed'

konverzi na 1b vadi i kdyz loadovanej soubor ma stejnej font
